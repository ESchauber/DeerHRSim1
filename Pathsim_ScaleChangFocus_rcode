# PURPOSE:  generates a simulated movement path with return tendency, based on biased random walk model parameters fitted to empirical data from white-tailed deer.  
# Each data set (site, deer, and season) has a set of fitted model parameters.  
# Simulation is based on the "FOCUS" turn angle model and "Scale Changing" step length model described in manuscript Kjaer and Schauber "Path-Based modeling of Home Range Behavior for Individual-Based Simulation:  White-tailed Deer in Forested and Agricultural Landscapes" being considered for publication
