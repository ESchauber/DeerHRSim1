==========

R code and data file (turn-angle and step-length model parameter values for each site, deer, and season) for biased-random walk simulations of deer home range behavior.

Simulations form part of the results of manuscript Kjaer and Schauber "Path-Based Modeling of Home Range Behavior for Individual-Based Simulation:  White-tailed Deer in Forested and Agricultural Landscapes" being considered for publication.
